Team Manager is a MERN project built from scratch. It incorporates various technologies such as Axios, Bootstrap, react-dom, and socket.io on the frontend for handling HTTP requests, responsive design, DOM manipulation, and real-time communication. On the backend, it utilizes cors, express, mongoose, bcrypt, cookie parser, dotenv, express-jwt, jsonwebtoken, validator, and mongoose-unique-validator for middleware, data modeling, security, token validation, and unique field enforcement.

The project offers a fully functional Login and Registration page for a seamless and secure user experience. It also includes a CRUD function for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. Additionally, there is a live chat feature powered by socket.io, enabling real-time communication between users.

The deployment of the project is on an AWS server, ensuring scalability, reliability, and robust performance.
